== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I deactivate Acunetix Secure WordPress once I've run it once? =

No.  Acunetix Secure WordPress needs to be left activated to work.  Version hiding,
turning off DB errors, removing WP ID META tag from HTML output, and other
functionality will cease if you deactivate the plugin.

= How do I change the file permissions on my WordPress installation?  =

From the Linux command line (for advanced users):
    chmod xxx filename.ext
    (replace xxx with with the permissions settings for the file or folder).

From your FTP client:
    Most FTP clients, such as FileZilla, etc, allow for changing file
permissions.  Please consult your client's documentation for your specific
directions.

For more information, please visit http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions

= Why do I need to hide my version of WordPress?  =

Many attackers and automated tools will try and determine software versions
before launching exploit code. Removing your WordPress blog version may
discourage some attackers and certainly will mitigate virus and malware programs
that rely on software versions.
